Deep Technical Review of Unlearnable Examples: Making Personal Data Exploitable Paper 

## Background 

As a part of the final project for Machine Learning 461 at Rutgers University with Karl Stratos, I chose a interesting Machine learning paper from a recent conference and completed a deep technical review.  The paper can be found <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04898"> here. </a>

## Components
* **Report.pdf** = This is my technical review of the paper. It includes the description of the experiments and my new modifications to the experiments 
* **Unlearnable-Examples/** = This folder contains a jupyter notebook *FINAL MINST QUICKSTART.ipynb*. This is the modified quickstart notebook to include the addition of a new dataset. Note that in order to run this notebook you will need access to GPUs. Google Colab has the functionality to run jupyter notebooks on GPUs. Unfortunately, they are often in use so you may have to pay for a subscription.
